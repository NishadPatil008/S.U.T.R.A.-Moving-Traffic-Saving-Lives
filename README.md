# 🚦 S.U.T.R.A. — Smart Urban Traffic & Response Architecture
### **MOVING TRAFFIC | SAVING LIVES**

**S.U.T.R.A.** is a decentralized, Edge-AI traffic management node designed to bring order to urban chaos. Unlike traditional blind timers, S.U.T.R.A. utilizes multi-modal sensor fusion—combining real-time computer vision and advanced acoustic processing—to dynamically manage traffic flow, instantly clear paths for emergency vehicles, and protect citizen safety.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features

* **Instant Emergency Preemption (EVP):** Utilizes YOLOv8 Vision to detect emergency vehicles. The system actively calculates bounding box area to identify the single largest emergency proxy (ignoring background traffic) and instantly forces the lane to a GREEN signal, bypassing normal delay cycles.
* **Strict Multi-Modal Fusion:** A configurable "Strict Mode" that requires *both* visual confirmation of an ambulance AND acoustic confirmation of a siren before overriding the signal, preventing false positives.
* **Acoustic Siren Recognition:** Employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Z-score tonality filtering via SciPy to isolate emergency sirens from ambient city noise(adjust sound freq from config).
* **Guardian Angel (SOS Signal):** Monitors the international "Signal for Help" hand gesture (Palm → Tuck Thumb → Make Fist) via MediaPipe to silently log distress events and alert authorities.
* **India-Specific Intelligence:** Includes "Project Nandi" for animal hazard detection and a specialized "Festival Mode" (with an auto-spawning UI tab) for accommodating religious processions without breaking traffic flow.
* **Interactive UI & Persistence:** Features a highly modern Dark Matrix UI with an interactive `/demo` tutorial sequence. The dashboard uses browser `localStorage` to perfectly remember your last loaded media feed even if the page refreshes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack


* **AI/Vision:** Ultralytics YOLOv8, Google MediaPipe, OpenCV
* **Signal Processing:** SciPy (Butterworth Bandpass Filtering), SoundDevice, NumPy
* **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript (Async Polling, LocalStorage), CSS3

## 📋 Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before running the system, ensure your hardware and software meet the following detailed specifications:

* **Python Version:** **Python 3.9.x, 3.10.x, or 3.11.x is strictly required.** *(Note: Python 3.12+ is not recommended as certain dependencies like MediaPipe and SoundDevice may lack stable pre-compiled wheels for newer Python versions).*
* **Hardware:** * A functioning Webcam (or virtual camera software like OBS) for the vision feed.
  * A working Microphone for the Acoustic Sensor (EVP) module to detect sirens.
* **OS:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Ubuntu/Linux.

## 📦 Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/NishadPatil008/S.U.T.R.A.-Moving-Traffic-Saving-Lives.git](https://github.com/NishadPatil008/S.U.T.R.A.-Moving-Traffic-Saving-Lives.git)
    cd S.U.T.R.A.-Moving-Traffic-Saving-Lives
    ```

2.  **Verify Python Version:**
    ```bash
    python --version
    # Ensure this outputs a version between 3.9.0 and 3.11.x
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Asset Check:** * Ensure your project logo is placed at `static/logo.png`. 
    * Ensure your media files are placed in their respective `static/images/`, `static/videos/`, and `static/sounds/` folders.

5.  **Run the Node:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    *Once running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.*

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.json`)

The system's core behavior can be tweaked without changing the Python code by editing `config.json`:

| Section | Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **camera** | `index` | Webcam hardware ID (default `0`). Change to `1` or `2` for external USB cameras. |
| **model** | `confidence` | AI detection threshold (default `0.55`). Dropped to `0.25` internally for deep background traffic processing. |
| **audio** | `chunk_seconds` | The buffer length of audio processed per cycle (default `0.4`). |
| **siren_detection** | `amplitude_threshold` | Sensitivity for isolating siren peaks from background noise (default `25.0`). |
| **traffic_controller** | `max_green` | The maximum dynamic extension time given to heavy traffic lanes (default `25.0` seconds). |

## 🕹️ Command Center Terminal

Use the integrated AI Command Panel located in the center of the dashboard to dynamically control the node during live presentations:

* `/demo` — Launches the **Interactive UI Dashboard Tour**, which physically highlights cards, dims the background, and explains features step-by-step to the judges.
* `/use image` — Scans the `static/images/` folder and lists available static testing scenarios. Type the corresponding number to load it (e.g., load `amb.jpg` to instantly trigger the Green Signal override).
* `/use video` — Scans the `static/videos/` folder and loads a local video traffic dataset.
* `/use audio` — Scans the `static/sounds/` folder, actively loads the audio file into the Acoustic Sensor panel, and allows you to manually press play to test FFT siren detection.
* `/use camera` — Instantly hot-swaps the feed back to your live hardware webcam.
* `/help` — Displays a detailed in-app manual of all available commands.
